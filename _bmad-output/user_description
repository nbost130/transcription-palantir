/Users/nbost/dev/transcription-palantir is an audio transcription system on my local dev box Mithrandir. I place audio files into the audio-to-process folder on my mac and they are moved to the inbox folder. Palantir picks them up and uses whisper to transcribe. We have a dashboard mithrandir-admin with a transcription section to monitor progress. The unified API centralizes various apis for mithrandir
